# Singly linked lists
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about linked lists in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-print_list.c` | Prints all the elements of a `list_t` list |
| `1-list_len.c` | Returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list |
| `2-add_node.c` | Adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list |
| `3-add_node_end.c` | Adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list |
| `4-free_list.c` | Frees a `list_t` list |
| `100-first.c` | Prints a message before main function is executed |
| `101-hello_holberton.asm` | Assembly code that prints `Hello, Holberton` only using `printf` function |
